Antithetical to what many might consider unwanted in a practice, the designers reflected in CCA MFA Design embrace the potential of interference. Combining arrays of disciplines, methods, and theories, they continually push the boundaries of what design is. Designers lean into the unknown made by interlacing unfamiliar frequencies of research and form-making.

The work encountered in this exhibition blurs the edges of definite design practice and creates a space where interference not only becomes an appreciated interaction, but a necessary element to the vocation.
